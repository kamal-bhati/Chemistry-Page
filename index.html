    <h3>Chemistry Assignment</h3>
   <p> Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe. </p>
   <h4>
Chemical Elements
</h4>
<p><span style="background-color: yellow;"> periodic table</span> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties. </p> 
<h5>Chemical Equations</h5>

<p> Chemical reactions are represented using <i> chemical equations</i> . Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i>  </p> 
<p> 
2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> 
+ 2H<sub>2</sub>
</p> 

This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).
<h5 >Important Concepts </h5>
<p> Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p> 
<p> <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts </sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p> 
 <h6>Conclusion</h6>
<p> plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives. </p>
